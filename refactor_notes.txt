MVP To-Do
- EBDX fixes
    - Includes everything about battle UI, sprite, etc. Will get more granular when I start working on it
- Re-enable PokeRadar
- Re-enable or just temporarily remove Trade Experts to avoid on-stream crash
- Re-enable Fly and Surf Mounts (low prio tho since we can Debug menu travel and walk on water)
- Properly set music during Mewtwo "boss" fight, also test if fight is too easy in current state
- Rebuild the translation files
    -Some unknown unknowns with this, but I believe I can utilize new code from v21 to pull the English translation from v16.
    Medium priority because essential game text is English, reading is for suckers, and mash A Andys won't notice anyway
- Figure out issues with Metrics for gen 9 pokemon
- get animated sprites back
- get custom sprites (megas, Maidible, Armor Mewtwo, etc) back


General Notes:
- :: references to Pkmn or item names need to be removed
    ex.  pbItemBall(PBItems::NAME)  ->  pbItemBall(:NAME)
- hasType(), hasItem(), etc. can replace janky code
    > $player.has_pokemon_of_type?(:TYPE)

Player:
    $bag.has?(:ITEM)
    $player.pokemonParty[0].species==:NINETALES -> $player.first_pokemon.isSpecies?(:NINETALES)
    pbRemovePokemonAt(0) -> $player.remove_pokemon_at_index(0)

Pokemon:
    pbPlayCry(PBSpecies::NAME) -> Pokemon.play_cry(:NAME)

Battles:
    pbWildBattle() -> WildBatte.start()
#-------------------------------

TODO
- Set Pokedex correctly - do we just use National?
    - "Classic" Mode might just be Kanto + Johto?
- General EDBX battle graphics cleanup
    - Setting backgrounds, trainer dialogue, etc.
- Re-enable Pokevial functionality (https://reliccastle.com/resources/405/)
    - does it need to be registered, or does Anil have it automatically hotkeyed?
- Re-enable PokeRadar
- Make sure all Trader NPCs are fixed
    - Finish trading NPC in Cinnabar Lab
- Re-enable Trade Experts
- Cerulean Gym Trainers swimming into wall?
- Game Corner Special NPCs and games
- Enable Surf Mount (low prio when you walk on water)
- Fix Seaform Island transitions, warps you halfway across the map
- Mewtwo Boss Music
- Mewtwo Boss Tuning



- Rebuild Translation files
- replace TMs with the moves they're actually supposed to be in Anil (i.e. update the TM # to match the move)
- import remaining unofficial Megas and any other Forms
- Check that Surf Mount and Fly Mount properly work, can be accessed in UI with Debug OFF
- Finish Encounter data reformat
- update audio loop settings
- check which battlebacks, BGMs, and other assets can be dropped back into EDBX
- update EDBX UI to be closer to Anil

- Update all Paralyze Heal references
- Put custom item assets back in (no thumbnail when hovering item in Bag)
- Fix EDBX Battle Speech (i.e. EndText)
- Double check trainer Event Touch vs Action Button to trigger trainer battles, some seem wrong
- update instances of $player.has_species?
- Double check all instances of frame-rate being locked then frame-waiting
   - Essentials moved away from frame-based timing, need to look at how this affects things
- Replace pbItemBall() with pbReceiveItem() when getting an item FROM someone, 2nd arg can be given for quantity
- re-add fancy badge animations
- Add UI element to display current Turbo Speed
- Update keybinds (or just update the Controls picture? Which is more "standard" for pkmn games?)
- Verify Pokemon "Yellow Version" features and ability for Pikachu


BUGS:
- PP Total # appears incorrect after using PP Up (i.e. Flamethrower 24/15)
- Long pause before Evolution cutscene plays
- Pokemon jump/dust? animation seems off, the landing part of the jump cloud is too low
- 2nd pokemon not properly going out for double battle?
    - Mewtwo sprite goes out, Zoroark moveset loads?
    - Used one move then it corrected itself
- "Aspirante David" walked through a different elevation to challenge in Mt Silver
- Game crashes after beating E4/Rival due to call to Global.Nuzlocke

IDEAS
1. Randomize gym leaders but preserve their types, make sure their last Pkmn is their "boss"
2. Generation on/off from debug
