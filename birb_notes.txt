TODO:
- Remove NPCs and Events we won't be using
    - Alpha Hives?

- Put Randy in every Pkmn Center
- Fix TMs, randomizer is grabbing gen9 (i.e. I found TM60 and 073 Drain Punch)
- Replace EBDX Boss Battle (only used for Mewtwo fight) with something else
- Verify all battlebacks are properly set with OG battle system and assets
- Check if Mega-ing Pokemon still works (oops)
- PokeVial
- PokeRadar? (shiny chaining)
- Rival Name appears as "Blue" in battle
- Enemy Pokemon name cut off on "Sandy Shocks"
- Add graphical indicator of current game speed
- Keyboard entry plug-in

- Re-implement "Illuminator" item
