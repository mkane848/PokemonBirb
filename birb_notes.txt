TODO:
Missing Features:
- Surf Mount
- Incubator


Nice-to-have Features
- Add graphical indicator of current game speed
- Keyboard entry plug-in
- Mega works, but you have to press Z and no animation plays?
- Add "That's Keldeo" NPC somewhere


Clean-up:
- Remove NPCs and Events we won't be using
    - Alpha Hives? Then how do we give key for Mew?
- Armored Mewtwo fight:
    - Replace Blue's back asset, either remove background from ones I found or find new one with proper transparency
    - Make new Armored Mewtwo sprite include Gio?
    - Need to either remake battleback or just use a premade one
    - Can we disable status effects from working?
    - Can we disable or change the "A wild Mewtwo appeared!" message?
- Fix TMs, randomizer is grabbing gen9 (i.e. I found TM60 and 073 Drain Punch)
- Rival Name appears as "Blue" in battle
- Footprints missing in Pokédex, spotted with Ivysaur
- Update EARTHBADGE to show Urano rather than Giovanni
- Update SOULBADGE to show Koga and Sachiko
- Verify all battlebacks are properly set with OG battle system and assets
- Enemy Pokémon name cut off on "Sandy Shocks"
- Fully replace old DEXNAV logic to have "Encounters" menu option added after it's found, maybe rename it to match


Non-crashing Bugs:
- Fix "Flying Crinny" bug when moving player into Cinnabar Island map
    - can be consistently triggered by holding a direction while map transfering while Surfing
